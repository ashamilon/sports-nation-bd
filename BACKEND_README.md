## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- SQLite database

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up database
npx prisma db push

# Seed database with sample data
npm run db:seed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file:
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Key Relationships
- **User** → **Order** (one-to-many)
